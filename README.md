# IRC-Parser
Parses log file of a IRC client to measure statistics about conversations.
Currently, the focus is the number of times each user says something.  Also the number of times the word "throb" is used.
Currently optimized for HexChat log files, but will work for any log where the nick of person speaking is distinguished as <nick>
